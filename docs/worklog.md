# Worklog

A running record of what has been done, what was learned along the way, and what comes next. It sits between two other documents:

- [`docs/arkitektur-roadmap.md`](arkitektur-roadmap.md) (Swedish) is the plan: the decisions, the stages, and how each stage is verified.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) describes the repo as it is today: commands, environment, architecture.

This file answers "where are we, how did we get here, and what is next". When resuming, read *Current state* and *Next steps* first, then the roadmap section for the next stage.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-20, after PR #14.

## Resuming checklist

```bash
cd ~/repos/trading-agent-system            # the WSL clone; the Windows clone is stale
git status && git branch -a                # expect master plus at most one working branch
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up -d                       # trading-db; needs .env in the repo root
cd src/agents && uv sync                   # Python dependencies from uv.lock
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/tags    # is Ollama on Windows reachable from WSL?
```

Then run the CI checks listed in CLAUDE.md before changing anything, so that a failure is known to be pre-existing.

## Current state

- **Stage 0 is done** (2026-09-19), and the CI gate is verified in both directions.
- **Stage 1 is in progress.** Its two .NET pull requests are merged; the three Python ones are not started. Stages 2–8 exist only as plan.
- **`master` is at `41a5d3d`** (PR #14). Every CI job and CodeQL are green there.
- **No open pull requests.**
- **Branches:** `master` only, locally and on GitHub.
- **The engine now reports outcomes honestly; the agent service still does not.** The engine reads its tickers, risk limit and timeouts from validated configuration, tells a failing agent service apart from a HOLD, and refuses an answer about another ticker. On the Python side any error is still a HOLD with HTTP 200, so the engine cannot yet tell "the model chose HOLD" from "Ollama is down". Closing that gap is the rest of stage 1.

## Next steps

In order. Each is one branch, one commit and one PR.

Stage 1 (roadmap estimate: 2 days) is split into five pull requests. The two .NET ones are merged.

1. ~~`TradeDecisionResult` and the ticker mismatch guard~~ — done, PR #13.
2. ~~Typed options, `ValidateOnStart` and a resilient client~~ — done, PR #14.
3. **Python typed configuration** (next): `app/settings.py` with pydantic-settings and `SecretStr`; `load_dotenv` out of `app/__init__.py`; a FastAPI `lifespan` that builds the LLM config and the HTTP clients once. That also fixes the event-loop-bound clients and the `httpx`/`httpx2` `type: ignore` in `memory.py`.
4. **Honest errors:** typed exceptions mapped to 200, 422, 502, 503 and 504 instead of the catch-all HOLD; a global handler that returns `{error_code, correlation_id}` and never `str(e)`; JSON logs with `X-Correlation-Id`; `/health` separate from `/ready`. This PR also carries finding A below, because it is what makes a 5xx reachable, and the single HTTP-level test that pins today's behaviour before `team.py` is rewritten in stages 2–3.
5. **`X-Api-Key`** with a constant-time comparison.

**Stage 1 is done when** stopping Ollama mid-run makes the engine log that the agent service is unavailable instead of recording a HOLD, and a call without the API key is rejected. Verifying that needs PRs 3 and 4 together.

After stage 1, and in any case before the contract changes in stage 3: finding C.

## Open findings

Six findings from a review of the repository on 2026-09-20. Every one was reproduced before it
was written down, and the reproduction is the *Verified* line. They live here rather than in the
roadmap on purpose: the plan should change when a stage starts, not every time a finding arrives.

### A — a failed analysis is sent twice

The resilience pipeline retries on a failing *response*, not just on a failing connection, so a
5xx costs two full analyses. A 5xx arrives after the agents have already spent 12–15 s of LLM
time, so the retry buys nothing and pays twice. From stage 4 it is worse than wasteful: one
logical cycle becomes two rows in `decisions`, `orders` and `agent_memories`, and the attempt
timeout abandons the first request without stopping the work behind it on the Python side.

This is harmless today only because the agent service answers HTTP 200 to everything, so a 5xx
never happens. **PR 4 is what makes it reachable**, which is why the policy belongs there and not
in stage 4: retry a connection-level failure, never a response. The next cycle is the real retry.
Idempotency keyed on `correlation_id` is the heavier alternative if retrying a response ever
turns out to be worth it.

*Verified:* a counting primary handler behind the configured pipeline recorded **2 HTTP attempts**
for one call that ended in `AgentServiceUnavailableException`.

### B — a ticker is interpolated into the URL without escaping

`PythonAgentClient` builds `analyze/{ticker}` by interpolation, and `Ticker` only checks that the
string is not blank, so a ticker can walk out of the path or open a query string. Not exploitable
today, because tickers come from `appsettings.json` and the one place that parses an untrusted
ticker (the agent's answer) only compares it. It becomes real in stages 2–3, when screening
produces tickers from market data. `TradingOptionsValidator` uses the same weak check, so
configuration validation does not catch it either.

The fix is two-sided: a format rule in the value object (roadmap security point 4) *and* escaping
at the call site. The roadmap mentions only the first.

*Verified:* `"../internal/shutdown"` resolved to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/INTERNAL/SHUTDOWN`,
`"AAPL/../../admin"` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ADMIN`, and `"AAPL?x=1"` to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze/AAPL?X=1`. `Ticker.TryCreate` accepted all three.

### C — the proposal DTO accepts an answer that is not the contract

`InvestmentProposalDto` is a positional record with non-nullable `string` properties, but
System.Text.Json fills a missing member with `null` without complaining. A body that honours none
of the contract deserialises cleanly, `Action` becomes `null`, and the engine logs "No action" —
forever, quietly, at information level. It is the same failure as the HTTP 200 fallback, on the
.NET side.

Stage 3 plans exactly this migration (`stance`/`conviction` replacing `action`/`amount_usd`). If
Python ships first, the engine goes silent instead of raising. The fix is `required` members, and
the plumbing already exists: System.Text.Json throws `JsonException` for a missing required
member, which `PythonAgentClient` already translates into `AgentResponseInvalidException` and the
worker already logs as a warning. `JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` catches unexpected extra
fields as well, but it couples the two services' release order and is a separate decision.

*Verified:* `{"ticker":"AAPL","stance":"BUY","conviction":0.8}` deserialised to
`action=<null> amount=0 reasoning=<null>`, and `{}` deserialised to `ticker=<null>`.

### D — a currency mix is reported as a bug, not as an outcome

`ProcessProposalUseCase` promises in its own doc comment that "every expected outcome is
returned", but `Portfolio.ExecuteBuy` reaches `Money.EnsureSameCurrency`, which throws
`InvalidOperationException`. Nothing catches it, so it lands in the worker's generic handler as
`LogError("Unexpected failure")` with a stack trace. The same is true of the insufficient-cash
guard in `ExecuteBuy`. Neither is reachable while every instrument is priced in USD, so this waits
for stage 5's wider universe — but it belongs with the `Money` currency guard that stage 2 already
plans, along with the two tests that currently pin the wrong behaviour.

While in that code: `TradingWorker.LogOutcome` is a `switch` statement with no `default`, so a
sixth result type would be logged as nothing at all. A `switch` expression would have been a
compile error instead.

*Verified:* `portfolio.ExecuteBuy(new Ticker("NESN"), 1m, new Money(100m, "CHF"))` threw
`InvalidOperationException: Cannot mix currencies USD and CHF.`

### E — there is no trading calendar anywhere in the plan

The system analyses every 15 seconds, at night and at weekends, on stale quotes. Stage 5 fixes the
*cadence* ("the cycle follows the data"), and stage 2 checks `quote_as_of` for freshness, but
market hours, holidays and half days do not exist as a domain concept. For a system whose whole
goal is short-term movement, a trading calendar is a first-class domain concept, not a detail —
and "is the market open" is a pure function, so it is cheap to get right.

### F — outcome measurement ignores transaction costs

Stage 4 measures return against an index from `reference_price`, with no commission, no spread and
no slippage against a quote that may be minutes old. Over short horizons that cost is often the
entire difference between a positive and a negative edge, so the measurement will systematically
overstate the agents — in precisely the number that is supposed to decide whether the project is
worth continuing. A cost model belongs in the outcome function from the start; it is a pure
function and therefore an ideal test-first target.

### Considered and rejected for now

- **Start persisting decisions before stage 4, to stop losing evidence.** The argument is that a
  day not recorded cannot be reconstructed without lookahead bias, which is true. But what runs
  today is llama3.2 3B on one hard-coded ticker, with no sell logic and a HOLD-lie on failure.
  Recording that is recording noise, and a worthless baseline is worse than none, because it is
  tempting. The data becomes worth keeping once PR 4 makes failures honest and stage 2 makes the
  `FactSheet` deterministic.
- **"The roadmap may only change as a result of something that was built."** The right instinct —
  five commits have changed only the roadmap — but too strict a rule. PRs #10 and #11 came from the
  goal itself being sharpened (buy *and* sell), and a plan should follow a changed goal. Writing
  findings down here instead of in the roadmap is the softer version of the same idea.

## Open decisions and loose ends

- **Orphan Docker volume** `trading-agent-system_postgres_data`, left from the original compose file. It holds no user tables (checked on a copy). Deleting it is the owner's call: `docker volume rm trading-agent-system_postgres_data`.
- **Dependabot:** the first uv run failed (run 35465220355), but every Dependabot run on 2026-09-19 succeeded, so it looks like a one-off. Nothing to do unless it returns.
- **`github-advanced-security` fails on most pull requests** (#4, #5, #6, #10, #11, #13 and #14; it passed on #7). It is GitHub's Copilot "Code scanning AI findings" job, it is not a required check, and it blocks nothing — but a check that is usually red trains you to ignore red. Decide whether to switch it off under *Settings → Advanced Security*.
- **Swedish outside the agreed exceptions:** the `description` in `src/agents/pyproject.toml`, a log message in `team.py` (removed in stage 1), and the `Field` descriptions and validator message in `app/domain/models.py`. The last ones are sent to the LLM (in the JSON schema and in the retry error), so they arguably count as prompt text, and `models.py` is replaced in stages 2–3 anyway.
- **Known gaps pinned by tests,** documenting current behaviour rather than asserting the right one: `Money` treats `usd` and `USD` as different currencies, and `Position.AddQuantity` adopts the incoming price's currency. Stage 2 gives `Money` a currency guard, together with finding D.
- **Empty packages:** `app/application/`, `app/infrastructure/llm/` and `app/infrastructure/market_data/` hold only `__init__.py`.

## Working agreements

How the owner wants the work done. Apart from the language rule, none of this is in CLAUDE.md.

- **One commit per branch and pull request**, against `master`, so that each diff is small enough to review. Only `master` and the current working branch exist; a branch is deleted on both sides after its PR merges.
- **Present the next step and ask before starting.** Motivate every change: what it does and why it matters, not just which files changed.
- **Build and test before every push:** every CI step, locally.
- **Language:** replies to the owner are in Swedish. Everything in the repo is English, except the agent prompts and the roadmap.
- **No `gh` CLI or token in WSL.** Pull requests are opened from pre-filled compare links: `https://github.com/HampusVictoren/trading-agent-system/compare/master...<branch>?expand=1&title=...&body=...`.
- **Attribution:** commits written with Claude end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`, and PR descriptions end with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
- **Secrets are never printed,** not even to a terminal, and `.env` files are never committed. No volume is deleted and nothing is force-pushed without the owner's explicit OK.
- **More than one Claude session can work in this clone** (PR #10 came from a second session). Check `git status` and the current branch before starting. A staged file goes into whichever session commits next.

## Stage 0 log (2026-09-18 → 2026-09-19)

### Before stage 0

- **2026-09-17:** initial structure: the engine's DDD layout, the agent service and docker-compose.
- **`dc59b94` *Add MCP*:** the FastMCP server with `get_stock_quote`, backed by yfinance.
- **PR #1 `add-vector-db`** (merged 2026-09-18):
  - `0df01fd` pgvector memory: `memory.py` with `get_embedding`, `save_memory` and `search_past_memories`, using 768-dimensional `nomic-embed-text` embeddings.
  - `2aecd70` WSL/Ollama connectivity (`.env` loaded automatically, `127.0.0.1` everywhere), structured output with retries for the PortfolioManager, and a fallback of HOLD 0 USD instead of BUY 250 USD. Added CLAUDE.md. The underlying bug was WSL's NAT networking, fixed by switching WSL to mirrored mode.
  - `1302d80` the architecture review and roadmap, with decision 1 (the engine owns the money) and decision 2 (the engine owns trading data, Python owns memory).
- **`ed9c30f`** (pushed straight to `master`, before the ruleset existed): testing moved from the last stages to stage 0, and the contract moved before the pipeline.

### The work of stage 0

**PR #2 — repo hygiene** (`c4500fe`, *Make the repo reproducible and switch the codebase to English*)
- The packaging bug: `uv_build` assumed a `src/` layout, so the wheel held only a 52-byte stub, and the service ran only because the working directory was `src/agents`. Fixed with `module-name = "app"` and `module-root = ""`.
- Deleted `requirements.txt` (it contradicted `pyproject.toml`), four empty placeholder modules, the unused `stock_client.py` and the dead `ConnectionStrings` section.
- Added `TradingSystem.slnx`, `Directory.Build.props` with `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, `.editorconfig`, and ruff and mypy configuration.
- Comments, log messages and exception messages switched to English.

**PR #3 — test harness** (`3d9a8ab`, *Add the test harness and the first 30 tests*)
- `tests/Engine.Tests` on xunit v3 with Shouldly and NSubstitute: 19 tests over `Money`, `Ticker` and `Position.AddQuantity`.
- `src/agents/tests` on pytest: 11 tests that pin the `InvestmentProposal` contract.
- Two tests document known gaps (see *Open decisions*).

**PR #4 — CI** (`db3d154`, *Add CI with secret scanning and a packaging regression guard*)
- Four jobs: `Engine (.NET)`, `Agents (Python)`, `Secret scan` (gitleaks, with the binary checked against a SHA-256 pinned in the workflow) and `Vulnerability scan (advisory)` (`dotnet list package --vulnerable` and pip-audit).
- A guard that fails if `app/` is missing from the built wheel. It was verified to fail when the packaging bug is put back.
- Actions pinned to commit SHAs. Dependabot opens grouped weekly PRs for github-actions, nuget and uv.
- The PR also carried `2aa77d5` *Roadmap update* from a second session: decision 4 at the time (an instrument object and `TeamSpec`) and "no derivatives before the last stage".

**PR #6 — database** (`3c75c20`, *Let compose own the database and give each service its own role*)
- Compose owns `trading-db`: `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg16`, bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` only, with a healthcheck.
- `db/init/01-schema.sh`: schema `trading` owned by `engine_svc` and schema `agent` owned by `agent_svc`, with no access across them and nothing in `public`. Passwords reach SQL as psql variables.
- Random passwords in two gitignored `.env` files. The one in the repo root is for compose; `src/agents/.env` holds only the agent's `DATABASE_URL`.
- `memory.py` lost its `postgres:postgres` default and fails fast without `DATABASE_URL`.
- Verified: 8 of 8 isolation checks over TCP, and the memory smoke test as `agent_svc`.

**PR #5 — Dependabot** (merged after #6)
- *Bump the python group*: `mcp` 1.30 → 2.2 and `uv_build`, plus, not mentioned in the title, `fastmcp` 3.4.7 → 4.0.5.
- Green CI was not enough, because the MCP path has no tests. Verified by hand: `@mcp.tool()` still returns a plain function, `get_stock_quote('AAPL')` returned real data, and the full flow produced a real decision, not a fallback, in 13.7 s.

**Branch protection:** the ruleset *Protect master* (id 23708635), created in the GitHub UI.
- A pull request is required, with 0 approvals (a solo project). Deleting and force-pushing `master` is blocked.
- Required checks, with the branch up to date: `Engine (.NET)`, `Agents (Python)` and `Secret scan`. The vulnerability scan is advisory and not required.

**Verification** (PR #7, closed unmerged, plus a direct push):
- PR #7 broke one assertion (150 → 151). `Engine (.NET)` went red, the other checks stayed green, and the merge was blocked without any option to bypass it.
- An empty commit pushed straight to `master` was rejected with `GH013: Repository rule violations found`, citing both "Changes must be made through a pull request" and "3 of 3 required status checks are expected".

### After stage 0

- **PR #8 `roadmap-follow-up`** (`ba26bbe`): applied the review of `2aa77d5`. `TeamSpec` split into "the contract now, the internals when needed", which became decision 3; the System.Text.Json discriminator pitfall; instrument equality; stage 0 marked as done. CLAUDE.md's stale list of leftovers replaced.
- **PR #9 `ci-pin-runner`** (`7db8047`): runners pinned to `ubuntu-24.04`, because `ubuntu-latest` moves to Ubuntu 26 from 2026-10-19. The vulnerability job's uv cache turned off, because it raced the agents job for the same cache key.
- **PR #10 `roadmap-handoffs-screening`** (`8d102d1`, from a second session): the goal became "find buy and sell opportunities in stocks that should do well in the short term". Decision 4 became typed handoffs through `StepSpec.reads` instead of a shared `MemoryStream`, and decision 5 that code computes a `FactSheet` and screens while the LLM only interprets a shortlist. Stage 3 gained review rounds and `team_version`, stage 4 measures outcomes from the first decision, and a new stage 5 covers screening and selling; the later stages were renumbered (now 0–8). See *Open decisions* for the review.
- **PR #11 `roadmap-pr10-follow-up`** (`a2fe1b2`): applied the review of PR #10. Review rounds became a condition instead of a part of stage 3, so the first measured `team_version` is a baseline without them. Stage 5 gained deterministic exits in `RiskPolicy` (a stop-loss, a time limit counted from the last purchase, and a minimum holding period), and its cycle now follows the data: an instrument is analysed only when its `FactSheet` has changed since its last signal. Stage 4 measures every signal at fixed horizons and defines a hit per stance, and stage 5 reports purchases against the shortlist average. Verified along the way that AG2 runs `ask()` without `stream=` on a fresh `MemoryStream`, so decision 4 holds.
- **CodeQL default setup** was switched on in the GitHub UI for Python, C# and Actions. Its first run was on `dfe20e8`.

---

## Stage 1 log (2026-09-20 → )

- **PR #12 `deps-pin-fastmcp`** (`e0bc847`): `fastmcp>=4.0.5,<5`, so the next major version arrives as its own visible Dependabot PR, and `mcp[cli]` removed — the code never imports `mcp`, and fastmcp pulls it in anyway. The lockfile lost only `typer` and `shellingham`. Verified with a full run against Ollama rather than only the tests, because the MCP path has none and the HTTP 200 fallback hides a broken chain.
- **PR #13 `stage-1-trade-decision-result`** (`bb114aa`): `ProcessProposalUseCase` returns a `TradeDecisionResult` instead of throwing or logging. It is a closed hierarchy — a private constructor keeps every case in one file — with `Executed`, `RejectedByRisk`, `NoAction`, `InvalidResponse` and `AgentUnavailable`. `Ticker.TryCreate` parses an agent's answer without throwing, and an answer about another ticker is refused: without that check a model replying "TSLA" to a question about AAPL made the engine buy TSLA. The worker now picks a log level per outcome, so a risk rejection is information rather than an error with a stack trace behind it. Written test-first: 12 tests red before the code existed.
- **PR #14 `stage-1-typed-options`** (`c962c2e`): `AgentServiceOptions`, `RiskPolicyOptions` and `TradingOptions`, each `ValidateDataAnnotations().ValidateOnStart()`, plus a `TradingOptionsValidator` for the rule data annotations cannot express. **None of them has a default value**, so a mistyped section stops startup instead of running on a guessed risk limit. `AddStandardResilienceHandler` takes its attempt timeout from configuration and `HttpClient.Timeout` is `InfiniteTimeSpan`, so the pipeline owns the time — which matters more than it looks, because in WSL's mirrored networking a dead port hangs instead of refusing. The worker moved to `IServiceScopeFactory` and loops over the configured tickers.
  - A live run caught a regression the tests did not: a resilience timeout reached the worker as `Polly.Timeout.TimeoutRejectedException` and was logged as an unknown bug, undoing what PR #13 had just fixed. Corrected by translating transport failures inside `PythonAgentClient` into the two exceptions the port declares, and by demoting Polly's own telemetry to information. Afterwards the same run logged zero entries at error level.
- **Review of the repository (2026-09-20).** Six findings reproduced and recorded under *Open findings*; two suggestions rejected with reasons.

## Lessons and gotchas

Things that cost time or were not obvious. Most are also recorded where they apply.

**.NET**
- The .NET 10 SDK no longer runs xunit v3 through VSTest. `global.json` opts into Microsoft.Testing.Platform, and `dotnet test` then needs `--solution`.
- `dotnet new sln` creates an `.slnx` file on .NET 10.
- System.Text.Json polymorphism expects the discriminator first unless `AllowOutOfOrderMetadataProperties = true`. This was tested with a file-based app, which needs `#:property JsonSerializerIsReflectionEnabledByDefault=true`.
- `AddStandardResilienceHandler` decides what to retry from the *response*, not from the HTTP method, so it retries a POST. For an expensive, non-idempotent call that has to be narrowed deliberately.
- A resilience pipeline throws Polly's own exception types. Translate them where the adapter meets the transport, or they reach the application layer looking like bugs.
- System.Text.Json fills a missing member of a positional record with `null` no matter how non-nullable the property is. Only `required` turns that into an error.
- Microsoft.Testing.Platform does not print `ITestOutputHelper` output for a test that passes. To read a value out of a probe, assert it into the failure message.

**Python**
- `uv_build` assumes a `src/` layout. This repo needs `module-name = "app"` and `module-root = ""`.
- openai 3.x types its client against `httpx2`, so `memory.py` has a documented `type: ignore` until stage 1 moves client creation into the lifespan.
- AG2 1.0.5: `ask()` without `stream=` runs on a fresh `MemoryStream` (`stream or MemoryStream()` in `Agent._open_run`), so agent objects shared between requests do not leak history.

**CI and GitHub**
- A Dependabot PR title names only the packages whose requirement changed. Read the `uv.lock` diff: a dependency without an upper bound can move a major version silently, as fastmcp did in PR #5.
- Green CI is only as good as the tests behind it, and a fallback that answers HTTP 200 hides a broken chain.
- `setup-uv` caches by default (`enable-cache: auto`) and never saves again on an exact key hit, so two jobs that share a key race, and the loser lives with the winner's cache.
- `github-advanced-security` is GitHub's Copilot "Code scanning AI findings" job. It fails on most pull requests here and passed only on #7; switching CodeQL on did not fix it. It is not required and blocks nothing.
- A new ruleset starts with enforcement *Disabled*, and required approvals must be 0 for a solo developer, or nothing can ever merge.

**Database and environment**
- Postgres init scripts run only on an empty volume. A change to `db/init/` takes `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`, which deletes all data.
- `pgvector.asyncpg.register_vector` looks for the extension in `public`, so `vector` stays there.
- The psql variables `:'x'` and `:"x"` quote a literal and an identifier safely, so the shell never splices a password into SQL.
- Docker Desktop's WSL integration must be enabled for Ubuntu-24.04, or `docker` fails even though the binary exists.
- Ollama runs on Windows, and WSL reaches it at `127.0.0.1` only in mirrored networking mode. Use `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost`.
- Searching for `[åäö]` misses Swedish words without those letters. Two exception messages survived PR #2 that way.
